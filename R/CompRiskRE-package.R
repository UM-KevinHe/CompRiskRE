#' CompRiskRE: Relative Entropy Integration for Competing Risks Models
#'
#' The CompRiskRE package provides functions for discrete-time competing risks modeling
#' with Relative Entropy (RE) integration. It supports both composite failure time (CFT) 
#' prior models and cause-specific prior models, and includes simulation, model fitting,
#' and performance evaluation utilities.
